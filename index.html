    <div class="Recipes">
    <p>This recipe is from my grandmother and has been a family favorite for many years. My grandmother got this recipe when she worked for a bakery in her early teen years and has been using the same recipe ever since.</p>
    <p>Ingredient List:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plain Graham Crakers</li>
        <li>24 oz. Plain Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1.75 cups of sugar (divided)</li>
        <li>1 stick + 2TB of butter</li>
        <li>3TB of vanilla (divided)</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The Process</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in the microwave for one minute. The butter shouldn't be hot, but should be almost entirely in liquid form.</li>
        <li>Place 30 Graham Cracker Squares into a food processor.</li>
        <li>Pour melted butter over Grahma Crackers. Add 1/4 cups of sugar.</li>
        <li>Mix until crackers are thoroughly crushed.</li>
        <li>Press into 9-inch spring-form pan, going 3/4 up the sides of the pan. Set aside.</li>
        <li>After cleaning food processor, blend cream cheese, 1.5 cups sugar, and 3 TB of vanilla. Add eggs and mix. </li>
        <li>Pour mixture into crust.</li>
        <li>Back at 300 degrees for approximately 1 hr. The center should be a bit wiggly, no more than 3-4 inches in diameter of "wiggly-ness", though.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix together sourcream, 2-3 TB of sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla. Spread on top of the cake.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 minutes longer, then remove and allow to cool completely before placing in refrigerator.</li>
        <li id="important">Tastes best if left overnight to cool completely!</li>
